# MLWare'23 - Permutation Learning Challenge

## TEAM NAME: Predictive Panthers

### Secured 7th Position in the Leaderboard and Advancement to the Final Round!

### Introduction
We are thrilled to share our journey in the MLWare'23 Permutation Learning Challenge, organized by Technex. Our team participated with enthusiasm and dedication, and we are proud to announce that we secured an impressive 7th position in the leaderboard. As a result of our outstanding performance, we have advanced to the highly anticipated final round of the competition.

### The Challenge
In this context, the task was to solve a permutation learning problem using Computer Vision. We were provided with jumbled sequences of elements, and our objective was to design a parametric model that could accurately reconstruct the correct sequence from the given inputs. Permutation learning is a crucial technique in feature learning, and it plays a pivotal role in various real-world applications.

### Our Approach
To excel in this challenge, we devised a novel approach that combined state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques. Our focus was on optimizing the feature learning process, which we believed to be the key to successful permutation learning. Leveraging our expertise in Computer Vision, we carefully fine-tuned our model to learn rich features and representations from the sequences.

### Dataset and Preprocessing
The competition dataset provided a diverse set of jumbled sequences. Before training our model, we conducted extensive data preprocessing to ensure the best possible input for our architecture. We employed data augmentation techniques to augment the dataset and enhance the model's generalization.

### Model Architecture
Our model architecture was inspired by recent advancements in deep learning. We utilized a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal patterns within the sequences. Hyperparameter tuning and experimentation were instrumental in refining the model's performance.

### Training and Validation
The training phase was rigorous and time-consuming. We implemented an efficient training pipeline with various optimization techniques to speed up convergence. Cross-validation and validation on a held-out set were essential for assessing our model's generalization ability.

### Final Result
After a few days of hard work and dedication, our model achieved exceptional performance. The accuracy of sequence reconstruction on the test set surpassed our expectations, solidifying our position among the top participants on the leaderboard.
